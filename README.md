# LLVM-PowerConsumption
This project implements an LLVM pass to analyze the power consumption of every basic block within a Java application. The pass is designed to work with LLVM's intermediate representation (IR) generated from Java bytecode, allowing for power consumption analysis at a low-level code representation.

# Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **LLVM**
- **CLang**
- **CPP**
- **Java**
- **Python**
- **Selenium**

# Installation

- Install CLang and LLVM. For Ubuntu use the following commands:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install clang llvm
- Install C++ compiler. For Ubuntu use the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install g++
- Install Java Development Kit (JDK). For Ubuntu use the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install default-jdk
